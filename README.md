Contrastive-Loss - Used to implement a siamese netowork and use contrastive loss to optimize it. See how the network can separate different classes in higher space.

CustomTrainingLoop - Implementing a Custom Trainning Loop with Tensorflow.

Image Segmentation - Used to understand and implement image segmentation.

Sytle Transfer - Implement Style Transfer between images.

AutoEncoders-VAEs-GANs - Implement all of this algorithms in Tensorflow to understand the performance transitions.

DebiasingVAE - Implementing a Debiasing Varitional Auto Encoder which debiases human gender.

TensorFlow_BoostingPerformance - Boosting performance using Tensorflow and graph mode.
